A weather web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can provide users with up-to-date weather information, forecasts, and possibly additional features like location-based data, interactive maps, or personalized settings.

Functionality:
1.Weather Data Integration:

Use JavaScript to fetch weather data from a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc.). Display this data dynamically on the webpage.
Retrieve and display information such as current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for the selected location.

2.Location Selection:

Implement a feature that allows users to input or select their location, either through a search bar, geolocation API, or dropdown menus.
Upon selecting a location, the app should fetch and display weather information for that specific area.

3.Forecast Display:

Include a section or tab for displaying weather forecasts, showcasing predictions for the upcoming days or hours.
Present forecasts in a clear and understandable format, possibly using graphs, charts, or simple text descriptions.
Responsive Design:

Ensure the web app is responsive to different screen sizes and devices. Use CSS media queries to adjust layout and content presentation for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

4.Interactive Elements:

Implement interactive elements such as buttons or toggles for switching between different views (current weather, forecast), or for refreshing weather data.
Consider providing additional information on weather-related topics (e.g., weather news, tips for dressing in different weather conditions).

5.Error Handling and Feedback:

Handle errors gracefully, displaying meaningful messages if the location input is invalid or if there are issues fetching weather data.
Provide feedback to users during loading or data retrieval processes to indicate that the app is working.
Accessibility Considerations:

Ensure accessibility features are incorporated, like proper alt text for images, semantic HTML, and sufficient color contrast for readability.
